# About [reviewsby.us][rbu]

[reviewsby.us][rbu] lets you rate and review your favorite (and not so favorite) dishes and restaurants.  [Katie][] and I frequented restaurants like [The Cheesecake Factory][rbu1] and we'd inevetably order a dish that we really liked or sometimes a dish we could have done without. So I started logging them in my [wiki][]. Well, that worked for a while, but I thought letting other people in on the action would be even better.  So I created [reviewsby.us][rbu].  Now everyone has a site where they can share their dining experiences, and comment on their favorite dishes and dishes that they would rather avoid.

I want to stick to that mission and include features that make future dining experiences that easy. I hope you all enjoy it as well and can tell me how it can be improved.

## Who are you?

I'm [Dave Dash][sd], a freelance web developer, out of Minneapolis, MN.  Hence the abundance of Minneapolis-based restaurants.  

## Review Dishes and Restaurants

A lot of our focus is geared towards narrowing down on the menu item level.  Although we do allow people to review individual restaurants, the true value of this site comes from knowing exactly what meals resonated with people and what did not.


## Dining out

Personally I like to visit the site right before I go out to eat and see what things to avoid, what things I should get again, and what things I should try.  I hope others find it equally as useful.  [Let me know][contact] if you do, or if you could see it improve.
