PHP OpenID
----------

This is the PHP OpenID library by JanRain, Inc.  You can visit our
website for more information about this package and other OpenID
implementations and tools:

INSTALLATION
============

Follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies.

   - Enable either the GMP extension or Bcmath extension. (GMP is
     STRONGLY recommended because it's MUCH faster!)

   - If you plan to use SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL to store OpenID
     data, you'll need PEAR DB.  You can install this by running this
     as root:

     # pear install DB

     You'll also need to install and enable the appropriate PHP
     database extension.  Alternatively, you can store OpenID data on
     the filesystem instead of using a relational database.  Nothing
     special is required for using the filesystem method.

2. Copy the Auth/ directory into your PHP include path.

TESTING YOUR SETUP
==================

We recommend that you use our example code to test your setup.  To run
the example consumer or server, follow the instructions in the
examples/README file.

USING THE API
=============

The best way to get started using the API is to take a look at the
example consumer and server in the examples/ directory.  See the
examples/README file for more details.
