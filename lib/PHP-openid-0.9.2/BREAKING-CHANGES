What follows is a list of changes in this release that may break code
that uses PHP OpenID 0.9.1 or earlier:

 * Files were moved from Auth/OpenID/Store/ to Auth/OpenID/.

 * Files were moved from Auth/OpenID/Consumer/ to Auth/OpenID/.

 * The MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite stores were moved into their own
   files.  Requring SQLStore.php will not be enough to use these
   stores; require the appropriate store source to use it
   (MySQLStore.php, PostgreSQLStore.php, SQLiteStore.php).

 * Functions in FileStore.php were moved into the
   Auth_OpenID_FileStore class.

 * Functions in Util.php, although not necessarily used by your code,
   were moved into Auth/OpenID.php (to the Auth_OpenID class).

 * Functions in Auth/OpenID/CryptUtil.php were moved into the
   Auth_OpenID_CryptUtil class.
