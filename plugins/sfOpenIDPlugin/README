  * Subclass the BasesfOpenIDAuthActions and impliment an openIDCallback() function that executes after a successful openIDAuthentication.

    For example:

  {{{

    class sfOpenIDAuthActions extends BasesfOpenIDAuthActions
    {
      public function openIDCallback()
      {
        $openid = sfOpenID::simplifyURL($this->getRequestParameter('openid_identity'));
        // do something
        return $this->redirect('@homepage');
      }
    }

  }}}

This is the perfect place to log a user into a site or make them fill out a profile or whatever it is you do on your site once someone is authenticated.
